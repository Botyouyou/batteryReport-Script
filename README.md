# batteryReport-Script
This is a simple .cmd script that generates and shows a battery report for Windows devices.

## Motivation

I created this project to help users monitor their battery health and performance easily. 

## Features

- Generates a battery report in HTML format using the powercfg command
- Opens the battery report in the default browser using the start command
- Checks if the script has admin privileges using the net session command
- Displays a message to the user if the script is not running as admin using the echo command
